    <div class="projtextlong" id="dropdesc2">
        In collaboration with my three design team members - Guglielmo Fonda, Elisey Goland, and Sofia Wheeler, we tackled the issue of wasteful condiment packaging through a circular design approach.

Despite having only one week to complete the challenge, we invested time in researching and observing user interactions with existing products. Our findings led us to the realization that take-out food packaging often ends up in the trash for the sake of convenience, even when it could be reused.
<br><br>
To address this issue, we focused on developing a sustainable solution that wouldn't compromise user convenience. After extensive research, we designed a 100% dissolvable condiment package that breaks down completely when exposed to hot water. The form of our product, inspired by our research of polyvinyl alcohol, was created to convey its intended disposal while allowing for easy access to the condiments.

        Jo(e) House is a restaurant that invites both kids and adults to unleash their inner child and indulge in whimsy, while feeling right at home. The dishes are crafted with simple ingredients that offer a comforting taste, yet with a touch (or a ton) of obscurity that makes them exciting and new.
        <br><br>
        To capture the essence of the Jo(e) House brand, which is all about cozy playfulness, I explored different color palettes and typefaces that evoke familiarity and youthfulness. The logo and graphic treatments underwent several iterations until they  embodied these brand values.

        The Print Menu, designed to entertain guests while they wait for their meal, features an interactive maze game and coloring-book-like design. It's always accompanied by crayons to encourage creativity and play. As I moved on to digital prototyping via Figma for the Screen Menu, I aimed to retain the element of interactivity by introducing a "Choose Your Drink" game that appeals to the playful side of adults who want to join in on the fun.

        Imagine our civilization at least 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population.

        BSI HELMET <br>
        Framing Story and Process
    </div>

    <div class="projtextlong" id="bsidesc2">
        Together with my two group members, Kai Jin and Xingchen Cao, we created the contextual framework for a fictional future world and designed a product representative of that era. Our team was assigned the challenge of brainstorming, iterating and prototyping the BSI Helmet, a futuristic device designed to constrain prisoners.

        After careful brainstorming and iterating the framing story, we sketched out the initial object prototypes and proceeded to physically prototype the final design. In addition to the physical model, we created a mock web-based system to manage the user base for the helmets, along with a digital screen display that would accompany the device.
        <br><br>

        Summarized Framing Story: <br>
        In the future, a mutant gene gradually develops in a portion of the human population, resulting in a generation of highly intelligent people. However, world leaders view their existence as a threat to their power and pass an international law outlawing their freedom. These geniuses are arrested and thrown into prisons but are used for breeding to carry on their mutant gene. Non-genius citizens are banned from procreating, eventually leading to a future world where the entire population is equally genius. Prisoners are forced to take orally self-impregnation pills via a constraint helmet used to confirm their status as geniuses.

         I used Premiere Pro for video editing and Gravity Sketch for VR landscape prototyping. The mock-up runs at a faster speed than the helmet would in hypothetical real-time, allowing me to showcase the different stages the future-casted object would go through.</p>
